I am beginner-intermediate level using python primarily for BI/Data Science and it has cut down on my googling big time. As long as the user knows it isn\u2019t complete work and needs to be checked, it can be a huge help.",

        "Hi there, from the /r/Python mods.\n\nWe have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/python.\n\nThe reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of \"how do I...\" questions, so you will not get the best responses over here.\n\nOn /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places.\n\nWarm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
