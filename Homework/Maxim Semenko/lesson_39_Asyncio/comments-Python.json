        "Hi there, from the /r/Python mods.\n\nWe have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/python.\n\nThe reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of \"how do I...\" questions, so you will not get the best responses over here.\n\nOn /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places.\n\nWarm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Python) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

        "All three frameworks are amazing, and you will be fine picking anyone. But if you are starting, Flask should give you the best opportunity to learn and understand all choices related to your project. Flask is a micro-framework, which means the basic install has the minimum features to get your site running. As you grow your project, you have to decide ORM or not, how you handle user authentication, and so on. For example, Django will make many of those decisions for you, before you even need them.

        "My brother and I came from a family that ran a machine shop and both worked as mechanics (mine was short run in tuneups/oil changes, his in vicational school + dealerships). Both of us have long since transitioned to software and both found that the troubleshooting skills are similar. The ability to communicate what you found and how things work turns out to be a universal skill. Really, many skills transfer and we've both found it to be rewarding enough it's been a career for 20+ years in both cases.\n\nI've done both backend and frontend work and it really depends what appeals to you. Backend is more like working in a machine shop or doing transmission overhauls. You feel the accomplishment but it's not the sort of thing you show off to people or can see when you're done. Frontend/web/mobile can all be more visibly rewarding if that's the payoff you like. Hope that's some help.",
