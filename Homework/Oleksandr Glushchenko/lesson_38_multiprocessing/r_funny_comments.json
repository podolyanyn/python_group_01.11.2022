If anything I think the society has been getting less easily offended over time.\n\nYou used to not be able to show a married couple in the same bed on TV, then Monty Python's Life of Brian was banned from public showing in localities and even countries, there was the Satanic Panic and the PMRC stuff in the 80's, and in the late 90's and early 2000's we had people campaigning against video games like GTA III and Counterstrike, and against explicit rap lyrics and stuff like that. Now we choose subscriptions with uncensored nudity and swearing over cable TV, GTA V makes III look deserving of an E rating but it's more acceptable for kids to play it, and about the only person who got offended by WAP was mocked for it.

        "body": "Well, I'm sure there was probably some wording I used above that made it sound improbable. Let's see if context helps cement some plausibility. I worked for a commercial office furniture dealership, as a \"coordinator\" (aka data entry) for one of the sales leads. She had put together a bid document for a large office project, which included hundreds of individual private offices. Most of those offices had a \"rear\" surface, a \"return\" surface, and a primary desk surface. While some wanted rectangular desk tops and some wanted [\"P\" tops](https://www.officemodularconcepts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3127aa.jpg), most wanted [\"peninsula top\" desks](https://d2wvwvig0d1mx7.cloudfront.net/data/org/19991/media/img/cache/1000x0/2104878_1000x0.jpg). Each desk top shape and size had a different price, so it was important that we had a detailed list of every office's configuration (to make sure our bid was not too high, and that we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot on margin by coming in to low), and this was done on a room-by-room basis. Each room had all of the shared components and their prices in one line, and then the remaining lines for the items that were unique to the specific offices. This would be things like the drawer configurations for the storage pieces (if they wanted fewer, larger file drawers or more, smaller drawers for personal items), whether an office had overhead cabinets or not, if they wanted a fabric tackboard or a glass markerboard, the number of guest chairs, and finally the size and shape of the primary desktop. When creating this document, she set up the format for one office, copied, and pasted it for every office. And once she typed \"penisula\" once, the \"auto-complete\" built into excel just let her repeat it over and over and over again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the question of plausibility was about whether or not I made the joke to her, I can only say that I knew her for years before I worked there, and we had a shared appreciation for Monty Python and George Carlin. Not that those specifically have a lot of \"penis joke\" content, but just mentioned it to illustrate that we both had similar sense of humor, including some things that wouldn't be considered PG.\n\nIf none of that was able to sway your perspective, I guess I shouldn't quit my current job as a laid-off office furniture seller/full-time student to go into screenplay writing.",
