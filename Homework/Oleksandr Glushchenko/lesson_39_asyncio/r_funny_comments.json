        "body": "I didn't take a single coding class until I was 17, junior year of high school. It was one semester and taught me almost nothing due to going way, way too slow because most of the students and even the teacher barely understood the material. I still went to college for a bachelors in computer science without any issue. Most of what I learned that stuck with me from before college was primitive Microsoft's [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) in DOS and TI calculator BASIC on the TI-83.\n\nNowadays you don't need to deal with GOTO-ridden BASIC programming to get started, you have your choice of [visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language); programming and modding for your own fun in games like Skyrim, Roblox, Minecraft, or [many things written in Unity](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21); [futzing around](https://thenextweb.com/news/bored-at-home-heres-10-handy-tools-you-can-build-with-python) with an easily-readable language like Python; or making a light display with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).\n\nI got hired at my first job half because of my university degree and half because I documented and patched Dawn of War, and the latter was purely for my own entertainment, not resume building. Find something that you find interesting, a mod you wish existed for a game you play or a tool to serve a purpose of your own needs, and use that to have reason to commit to a task that you actually *want* to do rather than something assigned as homework. Fix a bug the game's official patches left unfixed, or a tool to reorganize your MP3 library, or search your school docs. Google is your friend here, there's certainly information to be found for every step of the way for whatever you're trying to do, whether that be the process to create a mod or the a Python library to read MP3 properties. For programming languages, you can also find tutorial books to help you get started, should you prefer learning from documentation.\n\nThis is also how you can get a feel for what you actually want to do with programming. I didn't come to realize until I was taking a course in [assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) at college that I was sick and tired of dealing with semicolon issues and off-by-one bugs (I wish I had Python back then, you can't have either problem there). I much prefer working with known-good software and ironing out the kinks as in enterprise (corporate software) support and IT work, rather than writing code and debugging it, but knowing how to program means I understand of the software can work and thus how it might fail. Maybe you realize you want to be working closer with hardware where you actually make something move with your code, and so working with the software of integrated chips used in dishwashers and sprinkler systems would be more satisfying, or even robotics. Maybe you want to write code used by tons of people and designing user interfaces and so lean more towards consumer software. Maybe you find end consumers to be obnoxious assholes and lean more towards IT work, writing custom tools for specific identifiable needs of your coworkers in between managing the network and managing software installations.",

Anyway I think it's more of a perception that the British are not funny, also a lot of them just don't really get a platform here to even show their stuff I was really hoping when Jimmy Carr started making shows and doing stuff here it would open things up for others, but I just don't think the cross over is there yet. Another Idea I have for why is that the watershed in the UK allows for stuff to be a bit more risky because they have more freedom  to do things and that is why when they brought over Skins to America it was horrible because they basically took an HBO level show about growing up and what it was really like and turned it into a MTV show that had none of the sincerity or realistic character development. I am 30 and I have been watching UK TV since I was about 17 it just was always more enjoyable to me, so I don't know maybe it's just a preference and I am wrong and thats why it won't cross over it's not as good, I don't think thats true but who knows I am just a person.",

Not funny to me. Doesn't make it Not comedy, also doesn't  make it not humorous to those that find it funny.\n\n\nthis is the proof of my point. monty python is objectively comedic because it has elements of comedy and believe it or not fits an almost scientifically crafted formula of what makes things comedy. this is true across the board. we can all find personally decide whether it makes us laugh or not but that is separate from the fact that it is a comedic thing.\n\n\nthis applies to what isn\u2019t funny as well. there are things that are literally lacking in comedy or anything humorous. you can still choose to laugh at it or not, but it is objectively an unfunny thing. example: the film the others. there is absolutely\nnothing comedic or funny about it. but if it made you laugh then by all\nmeans enjoy yourself.\n\nsame thing applies here in this video.\n\n\ncultural differences here do not matter in this context. because even if we are different in culture we are all still human. different cultures only dictate what comedic equations are used, but they aren\u2019t free from the reality of what is and isn\u2019t comedic\n\n\nthe only thing in this video that comes close to comedy is the halal comedy because right actually does something comedic. setting up a surprise or ironic situation. that is what makes things funny. the rest of the video is just him being rude with our provocation reason or punchline\n\n\n\nbtw i\u2019m not just making this up. there are entire college courses, schools, and infinite books documenting, exploring, explaining, and criticizing this",

The director of my program recommended me, gave them my resume, and told them I didn't have any direct experience but I learned quickly and might be a good fit.\n\n4 phone interviews next where I spoke with several people and explained each time that I didn't have the experience they wanted, but I would learn on the job and use my free time to learn on top of that. \n\nGot asked for an interview, same shit (though the CTO was in the room for it)\n\nGot asked back in for another interview.  This time, the software developer lead was in the room.  He didn't get up to shake my hand which felt unprofessional, but whatever.  When he DID stand up,  he pretty much slammed about 50 pages of java down on the table and said \"tell me what this program does.\"  I have C, C++, powershell, and some python but I've never even looked at java before.\n\nI did what I could, but he ended up, at one point saying \"why are you interested in software if you know so much about hardware?\"\n\nEveryone else was great, but after dealing with this dude I knew I wasn't going to take the job.  IT director said they'd call me by the end of the week to let me know.\n\nA MONTH later I got an automated email response that they chose another candidate.\n\nWhat a fucking waste of time, and their time was worth a hell of a lot more than mine.",

Some things about how we are built, they don't just change the physical reality. It challenges ethics, to think about female sexed women's fight for representation in front of transwomen's fight for acceptance and equality. Just as weight separates boxers in the ring, it might be okay to separate by other physical property in competitions.\n\nShould it be solved by a free-for-all-gender class on its own? Should we go with it knowing that at least for now, transwomen athletes are still uncommon and it might be years before the podium is overrepresenting transwomen?  Lots of options but the solution we pick shouldn't disregard the downsides. We can't avoid looking at facts with honesty.

So, you can be sure that every single 2021 Form 1099 has exactly the same fields. Create a table where each column is one of the fields from the Form 1099 (plus a primary key, some metadata, and other databasey crap), and jam every single 1099 for tax year 2021 into that table.\n\nWhen you receive a tax return, simply query the database to grab the submitter's EIN/TIN and total amount for each entry in table 1099_2021 where the SSN matches the filer's SSN. Now you have an array with those values and can match them up to what was filed by the taxpayer and you'll know immediately if they missed any or got anything egregiously wrong.\n\nRelational databases are INSANELY efficient at locating and outputting the data that is stored within them based on various criteria. Of course, I'm no DBA, and there are many more layers to the design of a database suitable for handling the millions of transactions that the IRS has to deal with each year in the span of weeks, but if you had to service even 1000 customers, the simple shit I typed above plugged into postgres and processed by a python script would work just fine.",

They think that with enough money and code, they can find *the*\nsolution to any problem, and *the* answer to any question.\n\nThe problem with that is that a lot of real world problems have more than one appropriate solution, or one correct answer.\n\nWhen I was reading the stuff that grammarly had put out, each sentence was perfectly clear, if a bit stiff. However, when you tried to read a couple of sentences back to back it started to feel like reading a chunk of code written in python or something, it was perfectly logical but each sentence was totally disconnected from the rest in tone.

        "body": "Well, I'm sure there was probably some wording I used above that made it sound improbable. Let's see if context helps cement some plausibility. I worked for a commercial office furniture dealership, as a \"coordinator\" (aka data entry) for one of the sales leads. She had put together a bid document for a large office project, which included hundreds of individual private offices. Most of those offices had a \"rear\" surface, a \"return\" surface, and a primary desk surface. While some wanted rectangular desk tops and some wanted [\"P\" tops](https://www.officemodularconcepts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3127aa.jpg), most wanted [\"peninsula top\" desks](https://d2wvwvig0d1mx7.cloudfront.net/data/org/19991/media/img/cache/1000x0/2104878_1000x0.jpg). Each desk top shape and size had a different price, so it was important that we had a detailed list of every office's configuration (to make sure our bid was not too high, and that we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot on margin by coming in to low), and this was done on a room-by-room basis. Each room had all of the shared components and their prices in one line, and then the remaining lines for the items that were unique to the specific offices. This would be things like the drawer configurations for the storage pieces (if they wanted fewer, larger file drawers or more, smaller drawers for personal items), whether an office had overhead cabinets or not, if they wanted a fabric tackboard or a glass markerboard, the number of guest chairs, and finally the size and shape of the primary desktop. When creating this document, she set up the format for one office, copied, and pasted it for every office. And once she typed \"penisula\" once, the \"auto-complete\" built into excel just let her repeat it over and over and over again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the question of plausibility was about whether or not I made the joke to her, I can only say that I knew her for years before I worked there, and we had a shared appreciation for Monty Python and George Carlin. Not that those specifically have a lot of \"penis joke\" content, but just mentioned it to illustrate that we both had similar sense of humor, including some things that wouldn't be considered PG.\n\nIf none of that was able to sway your perspective, I guess I shouldn't quit my current job as a laid-off office furniture seller/full-time student to go into screenplay writing.",

We would watch PBS, Benny Hill and Monty Python. Most of the jokes went over my head but it was so great to hang with him, giggling over the silly stuff that I did understand. \n\nI also watched a lot of documentaries with my dad as I got older, almost always PBS. Sometimes they were good, sometimes they were boring as hell. Sometimes even he fell asleep halfway through them. \n\nMy dad was a lathe hand and he worked long hours, usually 6 days a week. The company he worked for handled a lot of government contracts so it was not unusual for him to go in at 6am and get home at 9. \n\nWhen he was home he would do repairs to our home, help the grandparents and work on the various cars. \n\nAs a little one I cherished all the TV time I could have with my dad. As I got older I not only enjoyed our PBS moments but also fixing my beater cars with him.\n\nLet the little things become big things when they have happy memories.",
